    <p class="jc-paragraph" style="width: 100%;">
        You must beat the other player by choosing either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.<br>There are three outcomes, a win, loss, or draw, depending on which hand the player chooses.<br><br>
        For example, if one player chooses Rock, then the other player who chose Scissors or Lizard will be beaten, but will lose to the other player if they choose Paper or Spock, and etc.<br><br>
        If either player chooses the same shape,<br>then the round is tied and replayed to break the tie.
